        description: `University students face considerable difficulty when trying to manage their meal plans efficiently.<br><br>
        Meal plans provide convenience but they fail to supply students with essential budgeting tools throughout an academic semester.<br><br>
        Students frequently believe their meal plan money will last through the semester but unexpectedly find their funds depleted before the end.<br><br>
        This leads to financial stress and dependence on expensive or low-nutrition food alternatives.`,

        description: `Powerade isn’t just a drink—it’s fuel for champions. But to lead the sports drink market, it must rediscover its roots. Athletes and sports enthusiasts 
        may be the audience, but inspiration is missing. A brand without a story is a name without a legacy.<br><br>
        Born from the relentless spirit of runners—the athletes of speed and endurance—Powerade was once the pulse of those who lived to push limits. Young, driven, and 
        unyielding, they found solace in a drink that matched their pace. But as Powerade expanded, its essence blurred, leaving behind the runners who first made it great.<br><br>
        The BIG IDEA is a return to origin—a bold resurgence of endurance, momentum, and the unbreakable will to go further. This isn’t just about hydration; it’s about 
        igniting the fire of movement, the passion of pursuit, the thrill of crossing the finish line. The visual language will be daring, expressive, and explosive—a call 
        to action for all who strive for greatness.`,
