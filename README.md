MY STORY SRY I HAVE TO COPY AND PASTE AND TRANSFER HERE

titles canidates: sound barrier, a cricket's song, the hummingbird's song, hummingbird, cricket, noiseless, 

  A little boy aged just over 5 years headed towards a particularly long patch of grass in the backyard of the house in which he lived. The trees at the back of the yard provided little shade under the mid-day sun. The boy's mother and father sat on the porch, each reading a book; the mother, a very worn copy of a bible, and the father, a horrendously large editon of the best selling "Silent Manifesto". The boy had only ever heard his name spoken once, and it was earlier that year on his fifth birthday. In fact, he did not receive any other presents other than the seven letters that constitued his name spoken aloud. This was a gift, and although he was young, he would remember it for a long time. It was unlikely that he would hear his name spoken out loud again, and if he did, it most likely would not be for a good reason.  

  The boy sat on the ground in the middle of the grass and began to pull clumps of it out to make a small clearing. He then dropped a handful of sticks that he had been carrying and began to drive them in the ground, one by one. The boy leaned down to the ground until his cheek touched the dirt. When he looked at the tee-pee like structure he had built, he was able to see inside, and could imagine a family of three living within the walls. Suddenly, a movement out of the corner of his eye caught the boy's attention. A small cricket had jumped centimetres away from the structure of sticks.

  The boy, curious, reached out to touch the cricket. It jumped over the sticks and landed close to the boy's knee. He paused, then gently moved his finger in front of the cricket's head, waiting for it to jump away again. When it didn't move, the boy nudged it towards the tee-pee entrance. The cricket allowed this, and soon was inside the small structure, looking quite content for a cricket. The boy moved to lay down on his stomach, crossing his arms and resting his chin on his hands. The wind was blowing ever so slightly, allowing for a small relief from the heat of the sun. Then, the cricket started to play. Over the soft sound of the breeze, the cricket wasn't much louder. It chirped twice, then resorted to a steady buzz. The boy's parents both started at the sound of the chirp, but paid no further attention and resumed reading.

  The cricket chirped twice more, and then three more times, delighting the boy so much that he smiled. He studied the cricket while it made the steady buzz again. With his head still resting on his arms, he made an "o" with his lips and pushed air from his lungs. It sounded and looked like he was trying to blow out a candle. He tried again and again, until finally he made a small sound. It was a whistle so small and so short, someone else would have thought that it came from the cricket, but the boy's father had been watching and immediately stood up. The boy turned to see his father stomping towards him, and although the grass muffled the sounds of his feet, to the boy it sounded like hundreds of trees falling down in the forest. The boy was scooped up by his father and was marched back inside the house, followed closely by his mother who shut the door so softly that you would never know it was ever open. The boy did not whistle again. Outside, still in the shade of the new tee-pee home, the cricket was silent for a moment, and then let out seven long chirps.

  TWELEVE YEARS LATER

Every seat on the train was taken, and those who did not delight in being early were standing in the aisles, packed shoulder-to-shoulder. Almost every single person was holding a book, and they were either reading or drawing as the train raced past the farmland part of the route. Posters were hung around the inside of the traincar, adversting things like "IDK INSERT STUFF HERE MAYBE LIKE INCREASE YOUR OTHER SENSES OR EARPLUGS OR...". A couple holding hands are texting one another, smiling at words on their screen and sharing a glance every now and then. The train slowed to a stop. On either end of the traincar, two digital signs lit up and the name of the stop ran across the screen in neon red letters. People moved to the doors and exited, most with their books still in hand. One boy walked with the crowd, holding a purple rubber band and tying it acround his fingers.

  He walked home alone, with his backpack slung over one shoulder and the rubber band in his other hand. He wrapped the band between two fingers and stared at it for a moment. He was outside of his own house and no one was around. He strummed the band once and it vibrated, making a low hum in the process. He quickly grabbed the band and hurried inside. The house was silent. Light filtered in through the windows, giving a warm golden tone to the furniture in the living room. The boy walked to the kitchen, passing a number of stoic family photos hung on the wall. The kitchen was as bright as the living room, but the black and white checkered tiles on the floor made the room feel a bit colder. The silence in the house told the boy nothing about whether anyone is home-- it is usually this quiet. The note left on the kitchen table however, was indeed an indicator that the boy was alone. He picked the note up off the table and read the neat cursive handwriting that he recognized as his mother's. 
  {italics i >> Gone to the _____ convention. Please babysit for NAME IDK, she will be attending as well.}

  The boy read the rest of the note which said to take the leftovers from the freezer and that NAME IDK's son NAMEIDK2 would be home in less than half an hour. He sighed and stared at the rubber band again. Shaking his head, he opened the freezer and grabbed two containers, each containing frozen solid blocks instead of the warm liquid soup he ate two nights ago. He packed the soup along with his textbook, paper, journal, and pencils. Slinging the back over his shoulder once again, he left his house and walked down the street. NAME IDK lived three houses down. Their house was much bigger and their garden was much nicer. The driveway sloped upwards and wrapped around a flowerbed to make a small roundabout. Well-manicured bushes lined the side of the front lawn, and large planters held ferns at the front of the house. The boy sat on the front steps and took his journal out of his bag. He flipped through the pages until he found one that was empty and took out a pencil. He started his drawing with a singular point on the paper. He then drew long wavy lines all across the page, drawing until the page was full. It wasn't long before a boy with a mop of blonde hair came walking down the street towards the house. Both boys looked at eachother and waved, and the small boy let out a large grin. They entered the house through the overly massive door and kicked off their shoes. The blonde boy ran up to his room. His sock feet were muffled by the carpet going up the stairs. 

  The older boy headed to the living room where he opened his bag once more and pulled out his homework. He read from the textbook and organized his pages, but it wasn't long before he started tapping the eraser on his pencil on the table. He stared blankly at the pages, not knowing how to start answering his homework questions. The blonde boy walked into the room carrying his own textbook and a small portable whiteboard. He passed a blue marker to the older boy and kept a red one for himself. He sat down on the couch and began to scribble on the whiteboard. He passed it to the older boy who looked at the red ink. 
  {Did you bring dessert?}
  He wrote his response in blue. 
  {Only dinner. We can get something from the store after if you want}
  The blonde boy read his message, looked up, and nodded excitedly. The blonde boy's house was just as silent as his own. The two boys sat and tried to do their homework. After a while, the blonde boy tapped the other boy's shoulder and showed him the whiteboard. 
  {I'm hungry} 
  The older boy dug out one of the containers from his bag and passed it to the younger one. He turned back to his textbook and heard the first click of the microwave opening, and the second click of it closing. He turned his head back to the couch to look at the blonde boy's textbook. It was clearly a new edition, with a shiny dark blue cover and white lettering that read "DECREASING THE VOLUME/THE SILENCING/QUIETENING ETC IDK". He opened the book to where the boy had folded the corner of the page. 
  CHAPTER THREE
  One of humanity's greatest accomplishments has been reducing sound in the world. Not only are humans more attentive, but everything and everyone is more careful with their actions and words. BENEFITS INCLUDE
  1. Humans are more in tune with their other four senses. Touch, taste, smell, and sight are more atuned without the uneccessary accompanying sound
  2. By communicating through writing, humans can think about what they are going to say and speak/communicate more clearly and effectively. This encourages putting thought and intention behind every communication.
  3. Thinking is improved by eliminating aimless musical stimulation
  4. Overall clarity and improved train of thought result from sound reduction
  5. Creativity now flourishes ever more in every human being. Drawing, reading, writing, and creating are all encouraged. These creative acts enhance the four PRIORITY senses.

From other history books, you as a student may be wondering how the world implementing such a dramatic shift and successfully reduced all man-made noise. It may be hard to believe, but streets were once filled with cars honking their horns, and people walked around speaking loudly into their cellphones. Governments around the world took the following preventative measures to ensure that the world we know today came to fruition.

1. Initiate sound control force program to ensure that uncontrolled noises are addressed
2. Educate the youth to instill the importance of sound reduction
3. Invest in technology to reduce/eliminate sound (silent exhausts on cars, new devices that do not produce sound, etc.)

   The following are additional measures to achieve soundless bliss:
   1. Newborns are adminsitered C17H15N5O until the age of 18 months to significantly reduce crying noises. They are also kept in the hospital until the age of 4 months for the same reason

The boy closed the book and got up to make his own dinner. The two of them brought their bowls to the table. The blonde boy brought the tv remote to the kitchen and made a gesture that he wanted to watch while they ate. The older boy turned the tv on, and switched to a channel playing cartoons. The only sound now was the occasional bump of the wooden spoon against the bowl. The older boy checked his phone for any messages. He didn't have any that particularly interested him. The little boy started to lean on his chair, tipping it slightly to stand on two legs while he held the table. He was done eating, but the older boy wasn't. The blonde boy was watching the cartoons and seemed to enjoy them, but he was slightly restless, and he continued to tip the chair. On two legs, the chair balanced for a moment, and both boys expected it to come back down as it had. But the chair clearly had a change of heart, and instead of falling back to all four legs, the chair fell backwards and the blonde boy along with it. The crash of the chair and the boy was loud, but compared to the silence of the house it was deafening. Both boys froze. The blonde boy wasn't hurt, not badly, but he started to cry. He didn't cry out loud, but instead a few tears streamed down his face. The older boy looked at him, and something inside him stirred and felt uneasy. It was more than uneasy, something was unnatural about watching a small child simply cry without making a noise. He did not have time to process this feeling because no more than ten seconds had passed when a bright light above the front door lit up. The older boy's face paled a bit and he held a finger to his lips to tell the younger boy to be silent. He crept to the front and opened the door slowly and quietly. A FIGURE/ROBOT IDK stood outside, unmoving and noiseless. The figure handed him a card, not unlike one the ones people use for business cards, with two words written in bold black letters.
{FIRST WARNING} it read. The boy flipped over the card and read the back.
{You are on probabtion until 12am tonight. Another loud noise will result in a second warning}. 

The boy looked at the figure and gave a quick nod. The figure turned and left. It moved almost as if it were gliding, and the lack of sound only added to it's erieness. Turning around and heading back inside, the boy let out the breath he had been holding on to. Wordlessly, he walked back to the kitchen, lifted the boy and the chair back upright, and finished his dinner in silence. As he normally does. The blonde boy migrated over to the couch where he watched more cartoons, although a solemn look remained on his face for the rest of the night. Before the blonde boy was put to sleep, the two played DRAWING GAME NAME, which was a game where each took turns drawing and switching their papers every thirty seconds. Both boys were feeling a little better, but both were also moving much slower and much quieter, scared to make any noise at all. After the little boy was asleep, the older boy waited downstairs for the convention to end. Lights appearing outside the house told him that the blonde boy's parents were home. He anxiously waited by the door with the warning card in his hand. They walked in the house quietly, as if trying not to wake their son. The boy handed them the card and shouldered his bag, avoiding their eye contact. The mother silently gasped, putting her hand to her chest and looking at her husband with concern. The man acknoweldged the card, gave the boy a $5 bill, and ushered him out the door. For the blonde boy's parents, it wouldn't be an issue unless they failed to adhere to their silent routine before bed. However if there were any mistakes, the second warning would come and it would not be as slight as the first. The boy walked home, straining to hear any sounds that would reach his ears by accident. 

The next day, the boy woke up to his sun clock. The sun clock worked by beginning with a dim light that gradually got brighter, in an attempt to wake people up more naturally. The boy reached out and placed his hand on top of the light. At his touch, the light dimmed once more. In the bathroom, he turned the shower on and stepped inside. The shower used techonolgy that evenly distributed the water, so that the water hitting the shower floor was barely noticable. The boy then brushed his teeth and dressed. His parents were already gone for work. He could smell french toast and strawberries, and when he turned the corner into the kitchen, he saw a plate of breakfast waiting for him on the table. He ate, packed his things, and left the house. He took the train to school, as did most students. It was the quietest form of transportation and therefore the most used. After getting off at his stop, the boy walked his normal route. He took the long way to school because he thought it was prettier, and he got to see the small river that passed through part of the city. 

  The boy walked down the streets as usual. The houses here were about the same size as his own, but where he had grass, trees lined the street in front of almost every house. To his right, the houses and trees. To his left, a six foot wall made out of grey brick. The river lay on the other side of the wall. It was built to accomodate the houses that faced it. The noises from the river were undesirable for anyone living near, so the city had built a barrier in an attempt to block out some of the sound. Up ahead where the street curved to the right, the sidewalk on his side of the road continued straight. It eventually turned into a pathway that lead to a bridge touching either side of the riverbank. The wall ended just before the pathway. Just past the bridge was a field that led to a street, where the boy would continue his walk to school. He couldn't see over the wall unless he jumped or stood on his tiptoes. When he walked alongside the wall, he was happy enough to strain to listen to the river, and when he crossed the bridge, he normally stood for a moment longer to watch it flow and listen to the trickle of the water. 
  
  As he walked beside the wall, he was startled to hear a gentle humming. He stopped and turned to look for the source of the sound. There was no one behind him. He listened and heard it again. Looking across the street, he again saw no one. Suddenly, he heard light footsteps from the other side of the wall. The humming followed the steps and he realized someone was making noise as they passed by. The hum was a beautiful tune, and the sound was truly music to his ears. He paused again and listened to the hum and the steps grow nearer and then fade as the person passed him. He was too scared to look over the wall, and instead he hung back, clinging close to the brick. He watched the end of the sidewalk for someone to come into view. Then she appeared. She had IDK LETS TALK ABOUT HER APPEARANCE LATER. She started to cross the bridge, pausing in the middle to look left and right at the river. She didn't look back, not knowing he was there, and she didn't stop humming as she walked away. 

  The boy had never heard anything like it. He was astounded. No one that he knew ever talked, or even made intentional noise. The boy sat on the bridge and looked at the river. There were three instances where one was allowed to break the silence without fear of the silent figure things yes. People high up in large companies were given meeting priviledges and were allowed to dicuss once a week. Rumours say that even though they are allowed to talk at these meetings, they still use very few words. The second is at a child's fifth birthday, where the parents are allowed to speak their child's name out loud for the first and only time. The third is during sex, and it has to be approved by the government and you have to go to the special room or something I dont know but could be nice to have idk. He looked up to where the girl had gone and saw nothing but trees and the field. Instantly he regretted not getting her attention. The next day the boy walked to school with a quickened pace and an excitement that hung around him. He waited by the wall eagerly hoping to hear the girl humming again. The silence was deafening. It was even more so on the second and third days, where he waited and was late to class because he expected her to walk out from behind the wall once more. By the end of the week, he had almost convinced himself that he had imagined it, or at least it was a one-time wondrous thing that only happened to him and that he must be grateful for it nonetheless, when he heard it again on his way past the wall. It was a different tune than the one before, and if it was possible, it was even more beautiful. The boy wouldn't dare call out, so instead he did the next best thing he could think of. For the first time since he was five, he let out a small whistle and tried to match the sound of the girl's humming. It was a quiet whistle at first, but as soon as it got slightly louder, the girl heard it and stopped. Within seconds, her head popped over the top of the wall. She was clinging onto the lip of the wall as she tilted her head at him. He stared back. She dropped back onto the ground on the riverbank side of the wall and then jumped right back up, this time pulling herself to the top. She began to walk on top of the wall, towards the bridge, holding out both arms to balance herself. The boy walked alongside her on the ground on the boring side of the wall. She glanced at him often. He prepared to catch her if she fell. 

  When they got to the street that the boy followed to get to school, the girl turned to walk the other way. The boy tapped her shoulder and gestured with his thumb to tell her that the school was the other way. She shook her head and started to walk the opposite way again. The boy quickly took out his paper and a pencil, jotted down a few words and ran to catch up to her. He gave her the note and hurried the other way; partly to get to class in time and partly to avoid witnessing her reaction. The girl looked down at the note. It read;
  {Meet at the bridge? 3pm?}

  The boy sat at the bridge for the second time that week. He kicked his feet in the air, exasperated at the thought that she wasn't coming. He watched the river. He listened to the sound of his own breathing. He barely heard her sit down beside him and the sigh of relief was almost too loud for his liking. He smiled and she smiled back. He took out his paper and began to write again.

"what is your name?"
"NAMEOFGIRLIDK"
She handed him back the paper with her name and held out the pencil indicating for him to write his own name. 
"7LETTERNAME" She looked down at the paper and nodded. She held out her hands again asking for the paper and pencil back.
"i dont know anyone who knows how to whistle" She wrote.
"i found out i could do it by accident"
"do you normally whistle while you walk?"
"never. i only did it because i heard you"
she read his words and stayed silent
"what were you humming?"

She looked him in the eyes as if she was making an important decision. She made her decision and opened her bag to take out a small device. It looked like a phone, but it was older. She pulled out a second item that made 7LETTERNAME's eyes widen. He hadn't seen a pair of earbuds in real life. If she were caught with them, there wouldn't be any warnings; it would be straight to the HEARING PLACE OR JAIL OR SOMETHING. She plugged them into the device and set it on the bridge. There was no one around, but both of them looked every way to make sure. GIRLNAMEIDK looked 7LETTERNAME in the eyes one more time before she tapped the device a few times and pressed a play button. The earbuds were set on the ground, but the volume was turned up almost to full. This meant that the song was playing out loud, but still very quietly. 7LETTERNAME was in a trance. The music filled his ears and was quite literally all he could hear. It was unlike anything he had ever heard, and so in his mind he had a really difficult time comparing it to any experience he had ever had. Every vibration, every beat, every pulse coming from the device was like a dose of a drug delivered to his brain. He closed his eyes and let his fifth sense breathe. 

He opened his eyes when he felt GIRLNAMEIDK tap his knee. She was holding the earbuds in one hand. With the other, she reached down to pause the music. She looked at 7LETTERNAME and reached around his head to put the earbuds in his ears. He pulled away at first but let her do it. He watched as she turned the volume down slightly. Then she passed the device to 7LETTERNAME, who took it and looked down at it in his hands. Looking at her face one more time, he held his breath and pushed play. From GIRLNAMEIDK's humming, to the music playing out loud, 7LETTERNAME did not think that his surprise and awe could grow anymore. When he pressed play with the earbuds in his ears, he was struck with the most sensational feeling. He felt the music playing throughout his whole body. He was in another world. The sensations that he felt in his body and mind were incomprehensible. There were no words to describe his feelings.

I COULD END IT HERE AND I MIGHT
IF I DID A VIDEO IT WOULD END WITH HIM BEING TRANSPORTED AND A COOL MONTAGE OF HIM FLOATING THROUGH SPACE/THE UNIVERSE
KINDA DRAWING INSPIRATION FROM TAME IMPALA MIND MISCHIEF MUSIC VIDEO

in the cool montage include hummingbird and cricket

otherwise include shot at the end of hummingbird and then cricket







silent world

people only speak at home and at work

music is forbidden

efforts have been made all around the world to reduce unnatural noises (quieter cars, machinery, technology used to muffle sounds?)

even when people do speak they use very few words

in the schools they teach children to write, text

restaurants have self ordering
blah blah blah basically sound is reduced

NOW

we can have room for visual appeal and development

sound police, (something about the siren lol) no headphones no speakers
--> autonomous? robo police?

little boy is playing outside and hears a cricket and then tries to mimic, ends up whistling

gets in trouble obviously

everyone goes outside to listen to sounds

something is dropped and everyone is frightened but no one screams

boy starts whistling at one point (by himself)

going through daily
... is walking to school next to a wall and hears someone humming (pretty)
jumps/looks/gets around wall and sees a girl

gets excited obvi
next day he is excited to see her but she does not appear, he worries she was caught by the police
no girl for two/3 days (maybe he even lets out a whistle at one point)

finally she is there again, humming, he lets out a whistle to say hi 
she jumps up onto the wall to see who is making noise

stares, then walks along the wall with him below
they are silent together
(music starts playing here?)

they pass notes at school

"i dont know anyone who knows how to whistle"
"i found out i could do it by accident"
"do you normally whistle while you walk?"
"never. i only did it because i heard you"
she is silent
"what were you humming?"
"i can show you"

she wants to show him something, they go to _______ where she has a ipod? and earbuds

play music loudly without putting earbuds in (so that the music is heard but is quiet)
boy is stunned

girl convinces him to put the earbuds in and he is absolutely transported/floored

wakes up at home, maybe hums while he makes cereal-- almost right after he starts humming the "doorbell" goes off but the doorbell is some kind of light indicator

he freaks out and answers, but it is just a small child handing out "BE SILENT" brochures/pamphlets to every door

gets a text to meet girl at same place

she shows inside her bag and there are small trinkets and things

they set them up and it basically is a studio
(pieces of glass tied with string to make windchimes, grass things to make a flute or kazoo or whatever, sticks for drumsticks, SOMETHING TO MAKE A GUITAR OUT OF)

she shows him how to play one "instrument" and she hums and it is great

maybe the song turns into background music and there is a montage of them setting up more and more "instruments"

one time it is rainy and thunderstorming and so they are able to "play" their "instruments" loudly and they are laughing and happy

then obvi they both die or are taken away or are tortured with sound so they hate sound and end up hating eachother
OR they are not tortured and but still taken away but their music lives on forever somehow

is it too much to deafen them as a "punishment" like is that too gory -- however if i do choose this then i want them to still feel vibrations from music and still be happy with each other. include heartbeat as "vibration"

alernate ending --- they are being taken away from eachother and all of a sudden the boy's heart bursts open and starting singing and its ends with a performance by the heart

other final scene: shot of the place with all of their untouched instruments, maybe windchimes are still making noise
cricket is heard, then close up of hummingbird flying near windchimes
final shot with cricket noises

black

END CREDIT SONG WHAT THAT IS SO MUCH PRESSURE BUT IT MUST BE DONE
