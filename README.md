MY STORY SRY I HAVE TO COPY AND PASTE AND TRANSFER HERE

titles canidates: song of the cricket, the hummingbird's song, hummingbird, cricket, noiseless, 

  A little boy aged no more than 6 years headed towards a particularly long patch of grass in the backyard of the house in which he lived. The trees at the back of the yard provided little shade under the mid-day sun. The boy's mother and father sat on the porch, each reading a book; the mother, a very worn copy of a bible, and the father, a horrendously large editon of the best selling "Silent Manifesto". The boy had only ever heard his name spoken once, and it was earlier that year on his fifth birthday. In fact, he did not receive any other presents other than the seven letters that constitued his name spoken aloud. This was a gift, and although he was young, he would remember it for a long time. It was unlikely that he would hear his name spoken out loud again, and if he did, it most likely would not be for a good reason.  

  The boy sat on the ground in the middle of the grass and began to pull clumps of it out to make a small clearing. He then dropped a handful of sticks that he had been carrying and began to drive them in the ground, one by one. The boy leaned down to the ground until his cheek touched the dirt. When he looked at the tee-pee like structure he had built, he was able to see inside, and could imagine a family of three living inside. Suddenly, a movement out of the corner of his eye caught the boy's attention. A small cricket had jumped centimetres away from the structure of sticks.

  The boy, curious, reached out to touch the cricket. It jumped over the sticks and landed close to the boy's knee. He paused, then gently moved his finger in front of the cricket's head, waiting for it to jump away again. When it didn't move, the boy nudged it towards the tee-pee entrance. The cricket allowed this, and soon was inside the small structure, looking quite content for a cricket. The boy moved to lay down on his stomach, crossing his arms and resting his chin on his hands. The wind was blowing ever so slightly, allowing for a small relief from the heat of the sun. Then, the cricket started to play. Over the soft sound of the breeze, the cricket wasn't much louder. It chirped twice, then resorted to a steady buzz. The boy's parents both started at the sound of the chirp, but resumed reading when they saw their son. 

  The cricket chirped twice more, and then three more times, delighting the boy enough to make him smile. He studied the cricket while it made the steady buzz again. With his head still resting on his arms, he made an "o" with his lips and pushed air from his lungs. It sounded and looked like he was trying to blow out a candle. He tried again and again, until finally he made a small sound. It was a whistle so small and so short, someone else would have thought that it came from the cricket, but the boy's father had been watching and immediately stood up. The boy turned to see his father stomping towards him, and although the grass muffled the sounds of his feet, to the boy it sounded like hundreds of trees falling down in the forest. The boy was scooped up by his father and was marched back inside the house, followed closely by his mother who shut the door so softly that you would never know it was ever open. The boy did not whistle again. Outside, still in the shade of the new tee-pee home, the cricket was silent for a moment, and then let out seven long chirps.

  TWELEVE YEARS LATER

Every seat on the train was taken, and those who did not delight in being early were standing in the aisles, packed shoulder-to-shoulder. Almost every single person was holding a book, and they were either reading or drawing as the train raced past the farmland part of the route. Posters were hung around the inside of the traincar, adversting things like "IDK INSERT STUFF HERE MAYBE LIKE INCREASE YOUR OTHER SENSES OR EARPLUGS OR...". A couple holding hands are texting one another, smiling at words on their screen and sharing a glance every now and then. The train slows to a stop. On either end of the traincar, two digital signs light up and the name of the stop runs across the screen in neon red letters. People move to the doors and exit, most with their books still in hand. One boy walks with the crowd, holding a purple rubber band and tying it acround his fingers.

  He walks home alone, with his backpack slung over one shoulder and the rubber band in his other hand. He wraps the band between two fingers and stares at it for a moment. He is outside of his house and no one is around. He strums the band once and it vibrates, making a low hum in the process. He quickly grabs the band and hurries inside. The house is silent. Light filters in through the windows, giving a warm golden tone to the furniture in the living room. The boy walks to the kitchen, passing a number of stoic family photos hung on the wall. The kitchen is as bright as the living room, but the black and white checkered tiles on the floor make the room feel a bit colder. The silence in the house tells the boy nothing about whether anyone is home-- it is usually this quiet. The note left on the kitchen table however, was an indicator that the boy was alone. He picked the note up off the table and read the neat cursive handwriting that he recognized as his mother's. 
  {italics i >> Gone to the _____ convention. Please babysit for NAME IDK, she will be attending as well.}

  The boy read the rest of the note which said to take the leftovers from the freezer and that NAME IDK's son NAMEIDK2 would be home in less than half an hour. He sighed and stared at the rubber band again. Shaking his head, he opened the freezer and grabbed the dinner, which was frozen solid instead of the warm liquid soup he ate two nights ago. He packed the soup along with his textbook, paper, journal, and pencils. Slinging the back over his shoulder once again, he left his house and walked down the street. NAME IDK lived three houses down. Their house was much bigger and their garden was much nicer. The driveway sloped upwards and wrapped around a flowerbed to make a small roundabout. Well-manicured bushes lined the side of the front lawn, and large planters held ferns at the front of the house. The boy sat on the front steps and took his journal out of his bag. He flipped through the pages until he found one that was empty and took out a pencil. He started his drawing with a singular point on the paper. He then drew long wavy lines all across the page, drawing until the page was full. It wasn't long before a boy with a mop of blonde hair came walking down the street towards the house. Both boys looked at eachother and waved, and the small boy let out a large grin. They entered the house through the overly massive door and kicked off their shoes. The blonde boy ran up to his room. His sock feet were muffled by the carpet going up the stairs. 

  The older boy headed to the living room where he opened his bag once more and pulled out his homework. He read from the textbook and organized his pages, but it wasn't long before he started tapping the eraser on his pencil on the table. He stared blankly at the pages, not knowing how to start answering his homework questions. The blonde boy walked into the room carrying his own textbook and a small portable whiteboard. He passed a blue marker to the older boy and kept a red one for himself. 
  

  
silent world

people only speak at home and at work

music is forbidden

efforts have been made all around the world to reduce unnatural noises (quieter cars, machinery, technology used to muffle sounds?)

even when people do speak they use very few words

in the schools they teach children to write, text, and visualize their words
--> small device that attaches to your head and provides a transcript of your thoughts

restaurants have self ordering
blah blah blah basically sound is reduced

NOW

we can have room for visual appeal and development

sound police, (something about the siren lol) no headphones no speakers
--> autonomous? robo police?

little boy is playing outside and hears a cricket and then tries to mimic, ends up whistling

gets in trouble obviously

everyone goes outside to listen to sounds

something is dropped and everyone is frightened but no one screams

boy starts whistling at one point (by himself)

going through daily
... is walking to school next to a wall and hears someone humming (pretty)
jumps/looks/gets around wall and sees a girl

gets excited obvi
next day he is excited to see her but she does not appear, he worries she was caught by the police
no girl for two/3 days (maybe he even lets out a whistle at one point)

finally she is there again, humming, he lets out a whistle to say hi 
she jumps up onto the wall to see who is making noise

stares, then walks along the wall with him below
they are silent together
(music starts playing here?)

they pass notes at school

"i dont know anyone who knows how to whistle"
"i found out i could do it by accident"
"do you normally whistle while you walk?"
"never. i only did it because i heard you"
she is silent
"what were you humming?"
"i can show you"

she wants to show him something, they go to _______ where she has a ipod? and earbuds

play music loudly without putting earbuds in (so that the music is heard but is quiet)
boy is stunned

girl convinces him to put the earbuds in and he is absolutely transported/floored

wakes up at home, maybe hums while he makes cereal-- almost right after he starts humming the "doorbell" goes off but the doorbell is some kind of light indicator

he freaks out and answers, but it is just a small child handing out "BE SILENT" brochures/pamphlets to every door

gets a text to meet girl at same place

she shows inside her bag and there are small trinkets and things

they set them up and it basically is a studio
(pieces of glass tied with string to make windchimes, grass things to make a flute or kazoo or whatever, sticks for drumsticks, SOMETHING TO MAKE A GUITAR OUT OF)

she shows him how to play one "instrument" and she hums and it is great

maybe the song turns into background music and there is a montage of them setting up more and more "instruments"

one time it is rainy and thunderstorming and so they are able to "play" their "instruments" loudly and they are laughing and happy

then obvi they both die or are taken away or are tortured with sound so they hate sound and end up hating eachother
OR they are not tortured and but still taken away but their music lives on forever somehow

is it too much to deafen them as a "punishment" like is that too gory -- however if i do choose this then i want them to still feel vibrations from music and still be happy with each other. include heartbeat as "vibration"

alernate ending --- they are being taken away from eachother and all of a sudden the boy's heart bursts open and starting singing and its ends with a performance by the heart

other final scene: shot of the place with all of their untouched instruments, maybe windchimes are still making noise
cricket is heard, then close up of hummingbird flying near windchimes
final shot with cricket noises

black

END CREDIT SONG WHAT THAT IS SO MUCH PRESSURE BUT IT MUST BE DONE
