supposed to be about making waves


MY STORY SRY I HAVE TO COPY AND PASTE AND TRANSFER HERE
silent world

people only speak at home and at work

music is forbidden

efforts have been made all around the world to reduce unnatural noises (quieter cars, machinery, technology used to muffle sounds?)

even when people do speak they use very few words

in the schools they teach children to write, text, and visualize their words
--> small device that attaches to your head and provides a transcript of your thoughts

restaurants have self ordering
blah blah blah basically sound is reduced

NOW

we can have room for visual appeal and development

sound police, (something about the siren lol) no headphones no speakers
--> autonomous? robo police?

little boy is playing outside and hears a cricket and then tries to mimic, ends up whistling

gets in trouble obviously

everyone goes outside to listen to sounds

something is dropped and everyone is frightened but no one screams

boy starts whistling at one point (by himself)

going through daily
... is walking to school next to a wall and hears someone humming (pretty)
jumps/looks/gets around wall and sees a girl

gets excited obvi
next day he is excited to see her but she does not appear, he worries she was caught by the police
no girl for two/3 days (maybe he even lets out a whistle at one point)

finally she is there again, humming, he lets out a whistle to say hi 
she jumps up onto the wall to see who is making noise

stares, then walks along the wall with him below
they are silent together
(music starts playing here?)

they pass notes at school

"i dont know anyone who knows how to whistle"
"i found out i could do it by accident"
"do you normally whistle while you walk?"
"never. i only did it because i heard you"
she is silent
"what were you humming?"
"i can show you"

she wants to show him something, they go to _______ where she has a ipod? and earbuds

play music loudly without putting earbuds in (so that the music is heard but is quiet)
boy is stunned

girl convinces him to put the earbuds in and he is absolutely transported/floored

wakes up at home, maybe hums while he makes cereal-- almost right after he starts humming the "doorbell" goes off but the doorbell is some kind of light indicator

he freaks out and answers, but it is just a small child handing out "BE SILENT" brochures/pamphlets to every door

gets a text to meet girl at same place

she shows inside her bag and there are small trinkets and things

they set them up and it basically is a studio
(pieces of glass tied with string to make windchimes, grass things to make a flute or kazoo or whatever, sticks for drumsticks, SOMETHING TO MAKE A GUITAR OUT OF)

she shows him how to play one "instrument" and she hums and it is great

maybe the song turns into background music and there is a montage of them setting up more and more "instruments"

one time it is rainy and thunderstorming and so they are able to "play" their "instruments" loudly and they are laughing and happy

then obvi they both die or are taken away or are tortured with sound so they hate sound and end up hating eachother
OR they are not tortured and but still taken away but their music lives on forever somehow

is it too much to deafen them as a "punishment" like is that too gory -- however if i do choose this then i want them to still feel vibrations from music and still be happy with each other. include heartbeat as "vibration"

alernate ending --- they are being taken away from eachother and all of a sudden the boy's heart bursts open and starting singing and its ends with a performance by the heart

other final scene: shot of the place with all of their untouched instruments, maybe windchimes are still making noise
cricket is heard, then close up of hummingbird flying near windchimes
final shot with cricket noises

END CREDIT SONG WHAT THAT IS SO MUCH PRESSURE BUT IT MUST BE DONE
